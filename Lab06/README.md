#Lab 06 -- Binary-Search Tree
This lab gives you more practice with recursion in the context of a binary-search tree Abstract Data Type (ADT). You will work with a tree structure that supports dictionary-style operations such as inserting values, checking membership, and measuring properties of the tree. These operations provide a natural setting for recursive solutions and will help you strengthen your understanding of recursion and pointer-based data structures.

The lab has two parts. First, there is an onâ€‘paper exercise where you build and analyze a binary-search tree by hand. Then, you will move on to an implementation exercise in which you write code to support these operations in C++.
