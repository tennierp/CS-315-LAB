# Lab 06 Binary-Search Trees
This lab practices with recursion in the context of a binary-search tree Abstract Data Type (ADT). It shows a tree structure that supports dictionary-style operations such as inserting values, checking membership, and measuring properties of the tree. These operations provide a natural setting for recursive solutions and will help you strengthen your understanding of recursion and pointer-based data structures.
